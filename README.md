# 🎄 Advent of Code
[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an annual series of Christmas-themed programming challenges, designed to test your problem-solving and coding skills in fun and creative ways. Each day from December 1st to December 25th, a new puzzle is unlocked, following a festive Advent calendar format.

This repository contains my solutions to the Advent of Code puzzles. Each solution demonstrates how I approached and solved these challenges.
